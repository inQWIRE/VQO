abstract = {Quick Check is a tool which aids the Haskell programmer in formulating and testing properties of programs. Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},

To tackle the state-space explosion problem for quantum reasoning, we propose a Hoare-style inference framework that supports local reasoning for quantum programs. By providing a quantum interpretation of the separating conjunction, we are able to infuse separation logic into our framework and apply local reasoning using a quantum frame rule that is similar to the classical frame rule. For evaluation, we apply our framework to verify various quantum programs including Deutsch–Jozsa’s algorithm and Grover's algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel technique for the synthesis of imperative programs. Automated program synthesis has the potential to make programming and the design of systems easier by allowing programs to be specified at a higher-level than executable code. In our approach, which we call proof-theoretic synthesis, the user provides an input-output functional specification, a description of the atomic operations in the programming language, and a specification of the synthesized program's looping structure, allowed stack space, and bound on usage of certain operations. Our technique synthesizes a program, if there exists one, that meets the input-output specification and uses only the given resources.The insight behind our approach is to interpret program synthesis as generalized program verification, which allows us to bring verification tools and techniques to program synthesis. Our synthesis algorithm works by creating a program with unknown statements, guards, inductive invariants, and ranking functions. It then generates constraints that relate the unknowns and enforces three kinds of requirements: partial correctness, loop termination, and well-formedness conditions on program guards. We formalize the requirements that program verification tools must meet to solve these constraint and use tools from prior work as our synthesizers.We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by synthesizing programs in three different domains: arithmetic, sorting, and dynamic programming. Using verification tools that we previously built in the VS3 project we are able to synthesize programs for complicated arithmetic algorithms including Strassen's matrix multiplication and Bresenham's line drawing; several sorting algorithms; and several dynamic programming algorithms. For these programs, the median time for synthesis is 14 seconds, and the ratio of synthesis to verification time ranges between 1x to 92x (with an median of 7x), illustrating the potential of the approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of semi-automated inversion of imperative programs, which has the potential to make it much easier and less error prone to write programs that naturally pair as inverses, such as insert/delete operations, compressors/decompressors, and so on. Viewing inversion as a subproblem of program synthesis, we propose a novel synthesis technique called Path-based inductive synthesis (PINS) and apply it to inversion. PINS starts from a program P and a template T for its inverse. PINS then iteratively refines the space of template instantiations by exploring paths in the composition of P and T with symbolic execution. PINS uses an SMT solver to intelligently guide the refinement process, based on the paths explored so far. The key idea motivating this approach is the small path-bound hypothesis: that the behavior of a program can be summarized with a small, carefully chosen set of its program paths.We evaluated PINS by using it to invert 14 programs such as compressors (e.g., Lempel-Ziv-Welch), encoders (e.g., UUEncode), and arithmetic operations (e.g., vector rotation). Most of these examples are difficult or impossible to invert using prior techniques, but PINS was able to invert all of them. We also found that a semi-automated technique we developed to mine a template from the program to be inverted worked well. In our experiments, PINS takes between one second to thirty minutes to synthesize inverses. We believe this proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the viability of the PINS approach to program synthesis.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of synthesizing loop-free programs that implement a desired functionality using components from a given library. Specifications of the desired functionality and the library components are provided as logical relations between their respective input and output variables. The library components can be used at most once, and hence the library is required to contain a reasonable overapproximation of the multiset of the components required.We solve the above component-based synthesis problem using a constraint-based approach that involves first generating a synthesis constraint, and then solving the constraint. The synthesis constraint is a first-order ∃∀ logic formula whose size is quadratic in the number of components. We present a novel algorithm for solving such constraints. Our algorithm is based on counterexample guided iterative synthesis paradigm and uses off-the-shelf SMT solvers.We present experimental results that show that our tool Brahma can efficiently synthesize highly nontrivial 10-20 line loop-free bitvector programs. These programs represent a state space of approximately 2010 programs, and are beyond the reach of the other tools based on sketching and superoptimization.},

	abstract = {Current tools for fatigue life prediction of metallic structural components are limited in some or all of the following capabilities: geometry of, and boundary conditions on, the affected structural component, automation of the simulation process, randomness of the primary variables, and physics of the damage evolution processes.DDSim, a next-generation damage and durability simulator, addresses each of these limitations with a hierarchical, multiscale, “search and simulate” strategy. This hierarchical strategy consists of three levels. Level I, described in this paper, performs an initial, reduced order, conservative screening, based on a linear finite element analysis of the uncracked component, to determine the most life-limiting locations for intrinsic material flaws. Initial flaw size can be specified deterministically, or generated randomly from statistical descriptions of the microstructure and used in Monte Carlo simulation. The result is a scalar field of predicted life over the entire domain of the structure. The benefits of the Level I analysis include a high degree of automation, solution speed, and easy implementation of high performance parallel computing resources. A validation case study of Level I is described.Levels II and III are outlined herein, but will be described in further detail in subsequent papers. The Level II analysis uses FRANC3D to accurately predict the number of cycles consumed by microstructurally large crack growth processes. Level III performs multiscale analyses to accurately predict the cycles consumed in microstructurally small crack growth processes.},

[1], while using a purely classical modular multiplication circuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads originating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of some faults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware implementation. Our new (in-place) constant-adder, which is used to construct the modular multiplication circuit, uses only dirty ancilla qubits and features a circuit size and depth in O(nlogn) and O(n), respectively.},

We introduce a circuit which uses 2n + 3 qubits and 0(n3lg(n)) elementary quantum gates in a depth of 0(n3) to implement the factorization algorithm. The circuit is computable in polynomial time on a classical computer and is completely general as it does not rely on any property of the number to be factored.},

abstract = {The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.},

abstract="Integrating property-based testing with a proof assistant creates an interesting opportunity: reusable or tricky testing code can be formally verified using the proof assistant itself. In this work we introduce a novel methodology for formally verified property-based testing and implement it as a foundational verification framework for QuickChick, a port of QuickCheck to Coq. Our framework enables one to verify that the executable testing code is testing the right Coq property. To make verification tractable, we provide a systematic way for reasoning about the set of outcomes a random data generator can produce with non-zero probability, while abstracting away from the actual probabilities. Our framework is firmly grounded in a fully verified implementation of QuickChick itself, using the same underlying verification methodology. We also apply this methodology to a complex case study on testing an information-flow control abstract machine, demonstrating that our verification methodology is modular and scalable and that it requires minimal changes to existing code.",

abstract = {Reversible circuits for modular multiplication Cx%M with x < M arise as components of modular exponentiation in Shor's quantum number-factoring algorithm. However, existing generic constructions focus on asymptotic gate count and circuit depth rather than actual values, producing fairly large circuits not optimized for specific C and M values. In this work, we develop such optimizations in a bottom-up fashion, starting with most convenient C values. When zero-initialized ancilla registers are available, we reduce the search for compact circuits to a shortest-path problem. Some of our modular-multiplication circuits are asymptotically smaller than previous constructions, but worst-case bounds and average sizes remain Θ(n2). In the context of modular exponentiation, we offer several constant-factor improvements, as well as an improvement by a constant additive term that is significant for few-qubit circuits arising in ongoing laboratory experiments with Shor's algorithm.},

journal="Journal of Automated Reasoning",
year="2009",
volume="43",

pages="263--288",
abstract="This article presents the formal semantics of a large subset of the C language called Clight. Clight includes pointer arithmetic, struct and union types, C loops and structured switch statements. Clight is the source language of the CompCert verified compiler. The formal semantics of Clight is a big-step operational semantics that observes both terminating and diverging executions and produces traces of input/output events. The formal semantics of Clight is mechanized using the Coq proof assistant. In addition to the semantics of Clight, this article describes its integration in the CompCert verified compiler and several ways by which the semantics was validated.",

it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about correctness of classical
programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build
a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, we develop
a full-fledged Floyd--Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum
programs. It is proved that this logic is (relatively) complete by exploiting the
power of weakest preconditions and weakest liberal preconditions for quantum programs.},

abstract="We study the problem of pattern matching in languages whose type system is hierarchical and whose evaluation strategy is lazy. We propose an extension of the Puel-Su{\'a}rez compilation scheme to function definitions via order-sorted patterns. Pattern matching trees (PMT's) are defined to have edges labelled not only with structure, but also with subsort constraints. Due to this latter kind of edges, terms are reduced only as far as required to make either a structure or a subsort verification decidable. We show that the PMT is optimal if a decidable property of sequentiality holds for the sets generated during the compilation process. Our method turns out to be applicable for strict languages as well.",

abstract="The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is an important problem in several application domains, including low-power electronics and quantum computing. Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for various metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space required to implement a given function reversibly. However, little effort has been spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular importance in quantum computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to hardware, but also the estimation of resources required to implement a given quantum algorithm, a process that is crucial for identifying which algorithms will outperform their classical counterparts. We present a reversible circuit compiler called ReVerC, which has been formally verified in F{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$}and compiles circuits that operate correctly with respect to the input program. Our compiler compiles the Revs language [21] to combinational reversible circuits with as few ancillary bits as possible, and provably cleans temporary values.",

Emerging hardware is approaching a complexity that requires increasingly sophisticated programming and control. Scaffold is an older quantum programming language that was originally designed for resource estimation for far-future, large quantum machines, and ScaffCC is the corresponding LLVM-based compiler. For the first time, we provide a full and complete overview of the language itself, the compiler as well as its pass structure. While previous works Abhari et al (2015 Parallel Comput. 45 2–17), Abhari et al (2012 Scaffold: quantum programming language https://cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/TR-934-12), have piecemeal descriptions of different portions of this toolchain, we provide a more full and complete description in this paper. We also introduce updates to ScaffCC including conditional measurement and multidimensional qubit arrays designed to keep in step with modern quantum assembly languages, as well as an alternate toolchain targeted at maintaining correctness and low resource count for noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) machines, and compatibility with current versions of LLVM and Clang. Our goal is to provide the research community with a functional LLVM framework for quantum program analysis, optimization, and generation of executable code.}

abstract = {In quantum computing, the basic unit of information is a qubit. Simulation of a general quantum program takes exponential time in the number of qubits, which makes simulation infeasible beyond 50 qubits on current supercomputers. So, for the understanding of larger programs, we turn to static techniques. In this paper, we present an abstract interpretation of quantum programs and we use it to automatically verify assertions in polynomial time. Our key insight is to let an abstract state be a tuple of projections. For such domains, we present abstraction and concretization functions that form a Galois connection and we use them to define abstract operations. Our experiments on a laptop have verified assertions about the Bernstein-Vazirani, GHZ, and Grover benchmarks with 300 qubits.},

A fundamental reason is that dropping temporary values from the program state requires explicitly applying quantum operations that safely uncompute these values. We present Silq, the first quantum language that addresses this challenge by supporting safe, automatic uncomputation. This enables an intuitive semantics that implicitly drops temporary values, as in classical computation. To ensure physicality of Silq's semantics, its type system leverages novel annotations to reject unphysical programs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Silq programs are not only easier to read and write, but also significantly shorter than equivalent programs in other quantum languages (on average -46% for Q#, -38% for Quipper), while using only half the number of quantum primitives.},

discarded. Unfortunately, most existing quantum languages require tedious manual uncomputation,
often leading to inefficient and error-prone programs. We present Unqomp, the first
procedure to automatically synthesize uncomputation in a given quantum circuit. Unqomp
can be readily integrated into popular quantum languages, allowing the programmer
to allocate and use temporary values analogously to classical computation, knowing
they will be uncomputed by Unqomp. Our evaluation shows that programs leveraging Unqomp
are not only shorter (-19% on average), but also generate more efficient circuits
(-71% gates and -19% qubits on average).},

abstract="Salsa20 is a family of 256-bit stream ciphers designed in 2005 and submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project. Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently faster than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications. The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more important than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈{\thinspace}2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈{\thinspace}2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈{\thinspace}2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses the decisions made in the Salsa20 design.",

One emphasis of the model is brevity: using dependent types, type classes and notation we give the x86 semantics a makeover that counters its reputation for baroqueness. We model bits, bytes, and memory concretely using functions that can be computed inside Coq itself; concrete representations are mapped across to mathematical objects in the SSReflect library (naturals, and integers modulo 2n) to prove theorems. Finally, we use notation to support conventional assembly code syntax inside Coq, including lexically-scoped labels. Ordinary Coq definitions serve as a powerful "macro" feature for everything from simple conditionals and loops to stack-allocated local variables and procedures with parameters. Assembly code can be assembled within Coq, producing a sequence of hex bytes. The assembler enjoys a correctness theorem relating machine code in memory to a separation-logic formula suitable for program verification.},

abstract = {Quantum programming languages enable developers to implement algorithms for quantum computers that promise computational breakthroughs in classically intractable tasks. Programming quantum computers requires awareness of entanglement, the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes of qubits are correlated. Entanglement can determine the correctness of algorithms and suitability of programming patterns. In this work, we formalize purity as a central tool for automating reasoning about entanglement in quantum programs. A pure expression is one whose evaluation is unaffected by the measurement outcomes of qubits that it does not own, implying freedom from entanglement with any other expression in the computation. We present Twist, the first language that features a type system for sound reasoning about purity. The type system enables the developer to identify pure expressions using type annotations. Twist also features purity assertion operators that state the absence of entanglement in the output of quantum gates. To soundly check these assertions, Twist uses a combination of static analysis and runtime verification. We evaluate Twist’s type system and analyses on a benchmark suite of quantum programs in simulation, demonstrating that Twist can express quantum algorithms, catch programming errors in them, and support programs that existing languages disallow, while incurring runtime verification overhead of less than 3.5%.},
